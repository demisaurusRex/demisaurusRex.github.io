## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Flexbox isn't always needed. It was there but made it more confusing. I finished the positioning and pulled out the code that was doing the same thing.
Responsive design and how is relates to CSS classes.

### Continued development

Mobile responsive design and becoming more accustomed with how to use the ordering of CSS instructions within responsive design.
